# üöÄ HEREvolution Food Delivery App

Welcome to the HEREvolution Food Delivery App repository! üçîüì±

This repository contains the design files for the HEREvolution Food Delivery App, submitted for the HEREvolution Codefest-Hackathon.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Problem Statement
The challenge was to build a solution that optimizes food delivery routes for local restaurants using HERE Routing APIs and Mobile SDKs while minimizing environmental impact.

## üìù Solution Overview
Our solution focuses on developing a user-friendly mobile application that provides an optimized food delivery experience for both restaurants and customers. Leveraging HERE Location Services and Routing APIs, our app aims to streamline the delivery process while reducing environmental impact.
